## Eligibility and Participation Requirements



## Service Level Agreement

Response within 3 days determining whether or not the report qualifies for any bounty

If the report qualifies, determination of severity and size of reward within 7 business days.

Once the severity and bounty is decided, the Colony team will begin work on patching the bug.

In this case, a PR will be opened that references the issue of original report. This PR may request more information from the submitter of the bug, and may accept input from external developers for fixing.

When the PR closing the referenced issue is merged to the `/develop` branch (and, in the case of a live mainnet deployment, an upgrade has been successfully deployed), the issue will be considered "resolved" and payment can take place.

Time to remediation:
* Critical: within 3 days
* High: within 9 business days
* Medium: within 30 business days
* Low, within 60 business days
